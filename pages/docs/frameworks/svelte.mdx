Svelte is a cutting-edge, open-source JavaScript framework that differs from traditional frameworks like React and Vue. Rather than running in the browser, Svelte compiles components into highly optimized, low-level JavaScript code during the build process. This results in smaller bundle sizes and improved runtime performance. Svelte's unique approach eliminates the need for a virtual DOM and framework-specific runtime libraries, making it particularly attractive for building fast and efficient web applications. Developers write components using Svelte's concise and intuitive syntax, which automatically generates the necessary JavaScript code, making it a compelling choice for those seeking a lightweight and high-performance alternative to traditional front-end frameworks.
